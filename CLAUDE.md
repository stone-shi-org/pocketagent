# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install            # compiles node-pty and better-sqlite3 from source
pnpm dev                # API on :8787 + Vite on :5173 (use the Vite URL; /api and /health are proxied)
pnpm build              # protocol -> server -> web, in that order
pnpm start              # production: one process serves API, WebSocket, and the built frontend
pnpm lint               # eslint
pnpm typecheck          # tsc --noEmit across all packages
pnpm test               # vitest run
pnpm generate-token     # writes POCKETAGENT_AUTH_TOKEN into .env (mode 600)
```

**`packages/protocol` must be built before anything else works.** It is consumed as
compiled output, not source, so `lint`, `typecheck`, and `test` each run `pnpm protocol`
first. When editing protocol types, run `pnpm protocol` (or a full `pnpm build`) before you
trust a typecheck in `apps/server` or `apps/web`.

### Running a single test

Vitest is configured with two projects, `server` and `web`, from the root `vitest.config.ts`:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run apps/server/tests/sessions.test.ts     # one file
pnpm exec vitest run --project server                       # one project
pnpm exec vitest run -t 'detaches on request'               # one test by name
pnpm test:watch
```

Server tests run in `pool: 'forks'` with a 20s timeout: they spawn real PTYs, real tmux
servers, and real SQLite handles, so each file needs its own process. `tmux-backend.test.ts`
and `adopt.test.ts` skip themselves when `tmux` is not installed.

### Live demos

The unit suite cannot cover xterm rendering, a real agent, or a real tmux server. Six demo
scripts do, against a *running* server:

```bash
pnpm demo:protocol        # terminal transport over HTTP+WS
pnpm demo:browser         # terminal UI in real Chrome at iPhone viewport
pnpm demo:agent           # structured transport: events, approvals, reconnect mid-approval
pnpm demo:native-ui       # native UI in real Chrome: tool cards, diffs, approval sheet
PA_TOKEN=... pnpm demo:resume-adopt      # resume + tmux attach over the API
PA_TOKEN=... pnpm demo:resume-adopt-ui   # both pickers and confirmations in a browser
```

The first four read the token from `.env` and default to `:8787`. The last two expect a
*scratch* server (`PA_BASE`, default `:8788`) with a throwaway workspace root and
`POCKETAGENT_ADOPT_TMUX_SOCKET` set — they create files, start agents, and kill tmux servers.
Never point them at the real `.env` database; use a separate `DATABASE_PATH`.

## Architecture

PocketAgent runs a normally-installed agent CLI on this machine and drives it from a phone
browser. Two dimensions are independent and are the key to the whole design:

### Transports — how the agent is presented

Chosen per session; both live behind one session abstraction in `sessions/manager.ts`
(`ManagedSession = PtySession | StructuredSession`).

- **`terminal`** (`sessions/pty-session.ts`) — node-pty → xterm.js. Byte-exact CLI
  fidelity, answered with keystrokes. Works for *any* agent, including ones this codebase
  knows nothing about. `terminal/classifier.ts` produces non-binding UI *hints* only; it
  must never answer a prompt.
- **`structured`** (`sessions/structured-session.ts`) — the Claude Agent SDK. The SDK's ~40
  message types are collapsed by `sessions/normalize.ts` into the 11-event union in
  `packages/protocol/src/agent-events.ts`, so SDK shapes never reach the browser. Adding
  agent-side features means work here *and* in the React renderer — that is the price of a
  native feel.

`normalize.ts` is a pure function and returns `[]` for unknown message types; that is where
SDK upgrades should land first.

### Process backends — where the process lives

`backends/types.ts` defines `ProcessBackend`/`ProcessHandle`; everything above it (routes,
WebSocket, replay, persistence) is written against a handle.

- **`direct`** — child of this server. Dies with it.
- **`tmux`** — a tmux server on a private socket (`-L pocketagent -f /dev/null`) that
  outlives restarts; sessions are re-adopted on boot from `listRecoverable()`.

Structured sessions bypass backends entirely (the SDK owns the process). What is durable
there is the *conversation*, not the process.

### The two "take over existing work" paths

- `conversations/index.ts` — discovers Claude Code transcripts under
  `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<id>.jsonl`. The directory-name encoding
  (`/` → `-`) is **lossy and must never be inverted**: containment is decided by a
  forward-encoded prefix filter plus the `cwd` recorded *inside* the transcript. Resuming
  defaults to `forkSession: true`, because two processes resuming one id append to a single
  interleaved file and neither sees the other's turns.
- `adopt/index.ts` — attaches to a pane on a *foreign* tmux socket. Off unless
  `POCKETAGENT_ADOPT_TMUX_SOCKET` is set. The browser only ever sends an opaque
  sha256-derived id; the server builds the argv. Adopted sessions always use the direct
  backend, because what we spawn is a tmux *client* and killing it must only ever detach.

### The home screen

`projects/index.ts` composes `GET /api/projects`: live sessions and on-disk conversations
merged into one chat list per directory. Two rules live here — a session that resumed a
transcript hides that transcript's row (they are one chat, and the session is the live view
of it), and a chat's timestamp falls back through `lastActivityAt → startedAt → createdAt`
so a brand new one does not sort last.

`HostInfo` is first-class with exactly one entry: this server. The header chip, the
composer's host row and `GET /api/hosts` are all shaped for several machines so that a front
server registering backs would not force a client rewrite. **No such front server exists**,
and building one concentrates credentials for every registered machine in one process —
treat it as a design problem, not a feature request.

### Wire protocol

`packages/protocol` is the single source of truth: Zod schemas for every HTTP body and
WebSocket frame, shared by both sides. Bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in `ws.ts` when frames
change; the client sends it as `?v=` and a mismatch is rejected at connect.

Output replay is byte-oriented with monotonic sequence numbers (`terminal/output-buffer.ts`,
and `terminal/event-buffer.ts` for structured events). Each stream also has an **epoch**:
seq numbers are only meaningful within one run, so a resume with a stale epoch forces a
truncated full replay rather than splicing a corrupt ANSI stream.

## Invariants

These are load-bearing. Several were bugs first.

- **Never answer a prompt for the user.** No auto-approval anywhere: `permissionMode` stays
  `default`, `canUseTool` routes every call to the browser, and there is deliberately **no
  timeout** on a pending approval — an unanswered one must never decay into an allow.
- **Containment is decided with `fs.realpath` + `path.relative`, never a string prefix**
  (`workspaces/index.ts`). Resolve the whole path first, *then* test containment, or a
  symlink inside a root escapes it.
- **The browser never supplies a filesystem path outside a workspace root, an executable, or
  argv.** Adoption and resume both take their `cwd` from the server-validated target.
- **`cols`/`rows` are `nonnegative()`, not `positive()`** — a structured session has no
  character grid and reports 0. Requiring a positive value silently invalidated every
  `attached` frame for structured sessions.
- **tmux format strings use `|` as the separator, parsed right-to-left.** A literal tab is
  not passed through a tmux format unchanged; every line collapsed into one field and the
  poller concluded that all sessions had vanished. Session names may contain `|`, hence
  right-to-left.
- **Adopted panes are not resized** unless the user explicitly opts in — tmux sizes a window
  to its most recent client, so a phone would shrink someone's desktop.
- **Terminal I/O is never logged or persisted.** SQLite holds session metadata only; buffers
  are in-memory.
- **`POCKETAGENT_*` is stripped from every child environment** (`sessions/env.ts`) so the
  master token cannot leak into an agent.

## Conventions

- ESM throughout; relative imports carry the `.js` extension even in `.ts` sources.
- Comments explain *why*, especially where behaviour looks arbitrary — most of them record
  something that was verified empirically or that broke once. Match that density; do not
  narrate what the code already says.
- Frontend state is hand-rolled React (hash routing, no router or state library) and plain
  CSS in `apps/web/src/styles.css`. Keep it that way unless there is a real reason.
- **The theme is light, and `color-scheme` is pinned to it.** Everything reads from the
  token block at the top of `styles.css`; adding a raw hex outside it is how the palette
  rots. The one dark surface is the terminal (`--console`), because ANSI palettes are drawn
  for dark backgrounds.
- Icons are inline SVG in `components/Icon.tsx`, 24px grid, 1.7 stroke, `currentColor`. Add
  to that set rather than reaching for a text glyph or an icon font.
- The home screen carries no metadata per row on purpose — a chat is its title and, if
  running, a green dot. Structure comes from weight and whitespace, not borders and badges.
- `eslint.config.js` scopes browser globals to the Playwright demo scripts by filename — add
  new browser-driving scripts to that list.

## Environment

`.env` (gitignored) is required: `POCKETAGENT_AUTH_TOKEN` (min 24 chars, never
auto-generated) and `POCKETAGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOTS` (no default — unset must never mean the
whole filesystem). The server refuses to start without both. `.env.example` documents every
setting; the README covers deployment, the security model, and known limitations.

Default bind is `127.0.0.1`. This grants terminal access as your user, so exposing it is a
deliberate act — prefer Tailscale over `0.0.0.0`.
